# flights

This will be the initial repoistory where I will investigate scrapping flight comparision websites in order to find the average cost between locations.

Plans
[] Lookup list of countries:cities and get their ariport codes
[] Ensure this is formatted in the correct way for the flight web URLs required to search for flights
[] Build the web request for KAYAK
[] Format the results and capture the key results in a dataframe and save this to csv

Initially
[] Search the flight for tomorrow
[] Search one flight provider

Planned
[] Search flight for one week away
[] Search flight for one month away
[] Compare costs to another flight provider? Will require a lot of extra work
