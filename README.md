# flights

This will be the initial repository where I will investigate scrapping flight comparison websites in order to find the average cost between locations.

Plans

[x] Lookup list of countries:cities and get their airport codes 

[x] Ensure this is formatted in the correct way for the flight web URLs required to search for flights

[x] Build the web request for KAYAK

[] Format the results and capture the key results in a dataframe and save this to csv


Initial Plan

[] Search the flight for tomorrow

[] Search one flight provider


Planned

[] Search flight for one week away

[] Search flight for one month away

[] Function to match other names of countries maybe - i.e. Laos > Lao People's Democratic Republic > Lao

[] Have a close cities lookup feature, list of cities you're travelling to. Find cities with 50 miles of those cities

[] Compare costs to another flight provider? Will require a lot of extra work
